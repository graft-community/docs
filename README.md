## Supernode guides

### [Simple step-by-step Supernode setup instructions for non-Linux users](Simple-step-by-step-setup-instructions-for-non-Linux-users.md)

Detailed setup guide by [yidakee](https://t.me/el_duderino_007) to get a supernode up and running from scratch on a Ubuntu 18.04 system.
Highly recommended for new-to-Linux users to get going.

### [Docker supernode guide](GuideBuiltforUbuntuDebianGraftDockercontainer.md)

Instructions (by [Fez](https://t.me/Fezz27)) on how to run a supernode inside a docker container, which, among other things, allows you
easily to run the supernode on Linux systems that don't necessarily satisfy the official Ubuntu 18.04 release requirement.

### [Quick Setup Graft Supernode (Building from Source)](Setup%20Graft%20Supernode%20(Building%20from%20Source).md)

This is a condensed set of instructions to get up and running with a supernode.  Recommended for someone with prior Linux
experience, or who has gone through the setup before and just needs a quick refresher on the steps.
